# API

### Technology and design choices

For the API I decided to go with node.js, a technology I am confortable. 

- Database is handled by typeorm and sqlite for a fast and easy implementation.
- Implemented a REST API with express for a simple endpoint to use with the app.
- I haven't split entities or routes into their own files since the project is still fairly small

### How to run

`yarn && yarn start`
